While job hunting I've decided to set myself the personal project of building this website to keep myself busy and also as a way to present myself in a more interesting way than just a CV. I hope the website will also serve as a dashboard to present any future personal projects. If you are currently hiring please feel free to contact me anytime on my email or phone number below. I believe I could make a great contribution to my next project.`;
